Please remember that this is all Joanna Lee's personal list so opinions and view points may vary.

## Best Action Anime

**Attack on Titan**

Attack on Titan would have to be my top pick for the best action anime out of the millions of action animes out there. Let's talk from the very beginning. Knowing my short attention span, the first eposide is crucial as it must enagage and and convince the audience to continue watching the show. Attack on Titan jumps right into the action scene and automatically captures the reader's attention. The anime is about humanity living inside these massive walls in order to protect them from the titans of the outside world. The main character Eren Yeager, along with his friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Alert, try to take revenege on the Titans after their homes are destroyed by these monsters The  concept is new, fresh, and different from your typical action anime, which also makes it more interesting.

However, the best part about the anime has to be the *plot twists*. Every plot twist is unexpected in their own way and really keeps you on your toes while watching the entire thing. Because there are no spoilers aloud, I am not allowed to go much in detail but all I can say is **WOW**. I promise every eposide will have you wondering and longing for next week to come faster. Currently three seasons are out and season four is planning to be aired December 7th, which is very soon. I recommend you start watching so we can watch season 4 together.

- engaging
- interesting, new concept
- plot twists

## Best Romance Anime

**Rent-A-Girlfriend**

This one was hard to choose because everyone's opinions are different for this category. However, this anime was the one I enjoyed watching the most while it aired. I'm surprised I enjoyed it as it as much as I did because it isn't anything super special. Rent-A-Girlfriend is about a boy named  Kazuya is a 20-year-old college student who was dumped by his first girlfriend after one month. student. Depressed, he rents out a fake girlfriend, Mizuhara, but it doesn't just end there; he lies and convinces everyon that they are actually dating. He is in for a long ride as he meets new girls, tries to keep his fake realtionship a secret, and goes through challenges along the way.

Honestly, this anime isn't super plot heavy but more of a fun, light watch. A lot of moments will make you laugh but a lot of moments will get you upset as well. Personally, the main reason I really like the character Mizuhara. I really enjoy her strong personality and can't seem to find a fault with her. There is only a season one but regardless I choose this anime for the potential it has in season 2.  The official date is not released yet but it is confirmed that a season 2 will come out. If you are bored or just getting into an anime, this one is for you.

- funny, light watch
- relatable

## Best Animated Anime

**Demon Slayer**

Demon Slayer is hands down the **best** animated anime currently. Every fighting scene is *phenomenal* and the details that go into this anime is insane. Demon Slayer is about a boy named Tanjirou Kamadao who works to become a demon slayer to find a cure for his sister, who has turned into a demon. Throughout his journey he meets life long friends, battles enemies, and much more. Not only is this anime the best animated anime, the plot is **just** as good. Every single episode keeps you on your toes as Tanjiro goes on battles one after another. I guarantee that you will see waterworks multiple times throughout the anime as well. And I am not the only one who thought so, as Demon Slayer won 2019 Best Anime of the Year. Please check out the link attached below.

Although Demon Slayer did not receive best animation of the year, I can not say much as I did not watch the anime that did. However, I think Demon Slayer had just as much potential to win both awards. Demon Slayer 2 is coming out as a move in theaters soon. The official date was planned to be in October 2020 but was postponed due to COVID. This anime is a much watch.
